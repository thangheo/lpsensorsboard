# low power sensorsboard
a diy sensor network powering by battery with many sensors types for smarthome.
The PCB and schematic was designed using Kicad 6.0.
part of Firmware configuration is generated by STM32 CubeMX.

At current version supported sensors are Light intensity using photoresistor(very low light, < 5 Lux), 
CO2/humidity/temperature sensor from sensirion CSD41(from Seeedstudio
with Grove connector), an audio sensor(Microphone ), CO/NH3 sensor, AM2320 sensor for humidity and temperature.
I haven't test on real hardware since I only designed PCB and programed Firmware few weeks ago.
The Microcontroller is STM32L051 with Cortex M0+ core, in STANDBY mode power consumption can go as low as few micro amp.
From my calculation the device can run upto 7-8 month with 2 minutes measuring period with
 18658 Lithium battery(1000mAh). Without CO2 sensor it can run up to years without recharging
  battery since this sensor consumes half of the power (35mA in 70mA total).
