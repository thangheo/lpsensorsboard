# lpsensorsboard
a diy sensor network powering by battery with many sensors types for smarthome.
The PCB and schematic was designed using Kicad 6.0.
part of Firmware configuration is generated by STCube.
At current version supported sensors are Light(very low light, < 5 Lux), CO2/humidity/temperature sensor from sensirion CSD41(from Seeedstudio
with Grove connector), an audio sensor(Microphone ), CO/NH3 sensor, AM2320 sensor for humidity and temperature.
I haven't test on real hardware since I only design PCB and program Firmware few weeks ago.
